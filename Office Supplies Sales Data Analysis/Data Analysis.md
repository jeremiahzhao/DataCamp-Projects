# Office Supplies Sales Data Analysis

I did some data analysis on some sales data over four years for a company with multiple regions. 
Each transaction ID has information on the items purchased, date, region, etc.

The following graphs I made with Plotly show the insight I was able to derive.

_____________

## Sub-Category Sales by Region

This graph breaks down sales revenue from the different regions of the company for the sub-categories the dataset provides.

## Sub-Category Products by Region

We see the number of products offered from the different regions of the company with the different sub-categories. This allows us to see the distribution of the products. The Southern region seems to be lacking in inventory or simply has less buyers.

## Sales Revenue from Sub-Categories

This is a breakdown of the sales revenue from the sub-categories. We see that chairs and phones are the primary sales revenue sectors. However, it's also important to know the number of products sold in each sub-category is not equivalent. Nonetheless, good info to know.

_____________

## Sales Revenue by Month on Average

![newplot (3)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98020536/166426425-5868d7a1-b334-4224-9dd2-a03c231eaf41.png)

Here, we have a  lot of the sales revenue based on each month on average. We can see there is a peak in sales in the last four months of the year. We should look to do more promotional deals in those months.

_____________

## Sales Revenue Over the Years by Region

We have four subplots of a time analysis of the sales revenues by region. The central and eastern region clearly are doing well. Western region is on the rise but the Southern region is lacking.

___________

## Top 20 Products in Units Sold

This plot shows the top 20 products sold. Most of these products are cheap but they still generate traffic to the store. We could look at doing strong promotions on these products to bring more customers into the store to see the more pricey items. Many of these do already have a promotion of around 5%. It would be interesting to see the profit margin on each of these products.

This is the top 20 products generating the most sales revenue. Most of these products are more expensive including printers, copiers, phones, bookshelves, etc.
